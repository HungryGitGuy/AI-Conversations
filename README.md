# AI-Conversations
Fairly simple python script using the Ollama package to run two LLMs at the same time and have them talk to each other.

Make sure you have the ollama cli installed (https://ollama.com/download) and you use it to install the AI models you want to run. 
You'll also need a virtual environment with the ollama package installed.

The program comes with a test session called session1 that you can try running if you don't know what to make the AIs do. It defaults to gemma2 and gemma3, so make sure they're installed before you load session1!
